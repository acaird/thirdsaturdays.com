**Rules**
---
**Third Saturdays are on the third Saturday of every month**

Third Saturday dinners are scheduled infinitely in advance; they are always on the third Saturday of the month.  No surprises.

**Automatic planning**

You can have dinner with friends any day of the month, but that scheduling is on you.  The third Saturday is the standing date.  Plan for it.

**Judgement-free**

No one has to come, there is no judgement.  But you know when it is---it is the third Saturday of every month.

**Anyone can choose the location**

Anyone in the group can suggest a place to eat.  In fact, someone really should.

**Just us**

No kids.  No parents.  Guests are on a very limited basis.

**No talking about kids at dinner.**

We talk about them too much as it is.

**Stag eats and (more importantly) drinks free**

If you come without a partner, you don't have to pay.  Unless you are the only one there.  No dine and dash.
